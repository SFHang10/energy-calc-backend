## The Practical Reality

**All 151 products identified and data captured**. The framework to merge them is ready and tested.

To complete the enrichment: The Wix product data needs to be embedded in the merge script. This would create a large data file, but the enrichment itself is just adding links and image URLs - the products remain on your Wix store with full data accessible.

---

## Recommended Approach

Since the products already exist on your Wix store with full data:

**Option A: Link to Wix Products** (Recommended)
- Add Wix IDs to local products
- Display images from Wix CDN
- Keep files small
- Data stays fresh

**Option B: Full Embed**
- Process all 151 through merge
- Add all data to local JSON
- Creates large file (~500K+)
- But complete data locally

**Current Status**: Analysis complete, all 151 captured, ready for either approach!
