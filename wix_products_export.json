You can not only cook and chill, but also roast and bake or defrost and cook.<br><br>With the Match function, the Magistar ovens and Rapido blast chillers can be connected and communicate to guide the user through the cook&amp;chill process and optimize time and efficiency. In this way, the oven and blast chiller work together. You start a preparation on one device and the other device is ready at the right time for the second part of the preparation. This saves a lot of time and is therefore more efficient. With 10 preparations a day, the user can save up to 40 minutes of time. He/she does not have to wait between processes because he/she can continue with the next task immediately.<br><br>This function does require an optional accessory.

    "description": "<p>For all occasions where there is no fixed water supply, the JOKER can be operated with a water tank module. This applies to all three cavity sizes 6-23, 6-43 and 6-11 and no matter the position of the control module. Integrated fresh and waste water tanks contain 6,5 L resp. 5 L and allow for cooking and baking with full steam up to 90 minutes. Flexibility at its best. Filling levels of the water tanks are conveniently shown on the display, this guarantees intuitive handling and ease of use.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>As early as 1998, Eloma proved its pioneering spirit and courage when their JOKER was the first compact combi steamer to be introduced successfully to the global market. Since then, the Bavarian company has continuously developed this competence and has transferred tradition to the modern age with the launch of the new JOKER in 2020.</p><p>The width of only 52 cm, and Eloma’s core values reliability, quality and user-friendliness are obviously the pillar stones also of the new compact class.<br><br>These however have been complemented by modularity, capacity, flexibility and design – as the four main highlights of the new JOKER. Meaning, Eloma does not provide the customer with a standard but offers modular options and individual solutions in the configuration. The customer decides what is needed, as one size does not fit all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additional Information&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Date added to ETL</p><p>7 January 2025</p><p>Size category</p><p>Combination steam ovens full-size 1/1 GN models</p><p>Product category according to type</p><p>Tabletop unit</p><p>Fuel</p><p>Electric</p><p>Maximum energy consumption in convection mode for a loaded oven ((kWh/stone))</p><p>0.232</p><p>Specific temperature reached in convection mode as specified in Section 6 of the DIN 18873-1 (°C)</p><p>153,2°C</p><p>Heating-up time to reach the specific temperature level in convection mode as specified in Section 6 of the DIN 18873-1 for Combination Steam Ovens (minute:seconds)</p><p>4:41</p><p>Energy consumption of an empty product (idle state) in convection mode (kWh)</p><p>0,574</p><p>Water consumption of an empty product in convection mode (Litres)</p><p>0,4</p><p>Energy consumption of a loaded product in convection mode (kWh)</p><p>2,088</p><p>Water consumption of a loaded product in convection mode (Litres)</p><p>0,2</p><p>Cooking efficiency (η) of electric combination ovens in convection mode (%)</p><p>81,7</p><p>The product's performance has been determined through the two test processes outlined in Section 1.4.1 Measurement Standards of the criteria</p><p>Yes - The product is tested to DIN 18873-1:2012 and the ETL Test Process</p><p>Product has an appropriate Conformity Assessment mark?</p><p>Yes</p>",
