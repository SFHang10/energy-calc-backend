Subject: Urgent - Lost All Chat History After Account Migration - Need Account Merge

Hi Cursor Support,

I'm experiencing a critical issue with my Cursor account. After a recent update, I was required to sign in for the first time. I've tried signing in with multiple email addresses, but each time it creates a NEW account and I lose access to all my previous chat history.

My original account was an anonymous/local account (I never had to sign in before). I have a paid subscription on that original account, and all my chat history is stored locally on my computer but I cannot access it.

The chat history is stored in these database files:
- C:\Users\steph\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\[workspace-id]\state.vscdb

But I cannot access it because it's associated with my old anonymous account, not any of the new accounts created by signing in.

Account Information:
- Name: Steph Hanglan
- Email addresses tried: Stephen.hanglan@gmail.com, [your GitHub email if different]
- Machine ID: a3cd8065-0881-41ca-8f2f-12f00a65a621
- Device ID: e102cacf-24dd-4cad-b9e9-88a5770eff08
- Telemetry Machine ID: 5fc8b46c039e0c9d6b9e7ae9df61b2a267117fcd4e8d2b7bca40da46e8179482
- SQM ID: {19A4C9AA-91EF-45EB-811E-4C7D0404932C}

I need help to:
1. Identify my original anonymous account using the machine IDs above
2. Merge it with one of my new signed-in accounts
3. Restore access to my chat history

This is urgent as I'm in the middle of a big project and need access to my previous conversations.

Thank you,
Steph Hanglan
