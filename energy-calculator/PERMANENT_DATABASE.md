- **Heating Products**: 0.0L (no water usage)
- **Other Appliances**: Varies by product type

## EXPANSION PLAN:
- ✅ **Completed**: Added 57 new products across multiple categories
- **Next**: Add more product categories in small batches (5-10 at a time)
- **Never delete** existing products
- **Always backup** before changes
- **Test with small files** first
- **Include water usage** data for all products

## SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS:
- Low energy consumption
- Low water usage
- High efficiency ratings (A+++ to A++)
- Sustainable alternatives
- Water-conscious appliances
- Energy-efficient lighting
- High-efficiency heating systems

## EMERGENCY RECOVERY:
If anything goes wrong, restore from `product-database-backup.js`
This database is the foundation and must never be lost.

## TESTING:
Use `test-expanded-database.html` to verify the expanded database works correctly.
This will show all 139 products with water usage data and category breakdowns.

## NEXT EXPANSION TARGETS:
- Smart Home products (thermostats, sensors, hubs)
- Renewable energy products (solar panels, wind turbines)
- More office equipment (printers, monitors, networking)
- Additional restaurant equipment
- Commercial appliances
