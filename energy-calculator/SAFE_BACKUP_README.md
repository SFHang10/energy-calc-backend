# SAFE BACKUP - DO NOT DELETE
# Created: 30 August 2025
# Purpose: Backup of current working state before any changes

## CURRENT WORKING FILES (DO NOT MODIFY):
1. `energy-calculator-working-restored.html` - Main working calculator with ~80 products
2. `product-database-backup.js` - Backup database with 80 products
3. `load-database-safely.js` - Safe loader script

## CURRENT PRODUCT COUNT: ~80 products

## WHAT WE'RE PROTECTING:
- All current working functionality
- Product database structure
- Categories and subcategories
- ETL API integration

## NEXT STEPS (SAFE):
1. Restore current 80 products (no changes to existing code)
2. Add missing products in small batches
3. Never modify working files directly

## EMERGENCY RECOVERY:
If anything goes wrong, restore from these files.
