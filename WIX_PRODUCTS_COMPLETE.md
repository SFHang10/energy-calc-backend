## Product Categories

## What Happens Next

The merge process (when executed) will:

1. **Match** each Wix product with local products
   - By exact name match (best)
   - By partial name match (variants)
   - By keyword matching (3+ common terms)
   - By brand + keywords

2. **Enrich** matched products by adding:
   - ✅ Images if local has none
   - ✅ Enhanced descriptions if local is brief
   - ✅ ETL certification badges
   - ✅ Additional specifications
   - ✅ Wix product URLs
   - ✅ Wix product IDs

3. **NEVER overwrite**:
   - ❌ Existing images stay
   - ❌ Existing descriptions stay
   - ❌ Existing data unchanged
   - ✅ Only add to empty/brief fields

## Safety & Backup
