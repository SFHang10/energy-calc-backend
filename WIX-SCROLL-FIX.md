# ✅ Wix No-Scroll Fix Applied

## Changes Made to `product-qualification-search-WIX-STANDALONE.html`

### 1. **Added Wix Meta Tag**
```html
<meta name="wix-html-scroll" content="no-scroll">
```
This tells Wix that this HTML element should not have independent scrolling.

### 2. **Removed Fixed Height**
Changed from:
```css
min-height: 100vh;
```
To:
```css
height: auto;
```

### 3. **Added Overflow Controls**
- `overflow-x: hidden` on html, body, and all containers
- Prevents horizontal scrolling
- Lets Wix page handle all scrolling

### 4. **Responsive Width Controls**
- Added `width: 100%` to all major containers
- Prevents content from breaking out
- Ensures proper containment

### 5. **Enhanced Mobile Responsive**
- Better padding adjustments
- Smaller font sizes on mobile
- Improved button sizing

## How It Works in Wix
