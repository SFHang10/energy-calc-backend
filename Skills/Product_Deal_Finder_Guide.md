## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Product Identification

**If user provides:**

**Product name only** (e.g., "iPhone")
→ Ask: "Which specific model? (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 14, etc.)"

**Model number** (e.g., "SM-G998B")
→ Search directly for this model

**Serial number**
→ First identify the product, then search for deals

**Generic description** (e.g., "a good laptop")
→ Help narrow down: "What's your budget? Any brand preferences? Intended use?"

### Step 2: Initial Discovery (2-3 searches)

Conduct broad searches to understand the market:

```
Search 1: "[product] deals UK"
Search 2: "[product] price comparison Europe" 
Search 3: "[product] discount [current month]"
```

**Analyze results for:**
- Price range (low to high)
- Retailers stocking the product
- Active promotions mentioned
- Price comparison sites found

### Step 3: Deep Dive (3-5 additional searches)

Based on initial findings, target specific sources:

```
Search 4: Visit price comparison site URLs found
Search 5: "[retailer name] [product] offer"
Search 6: "[product] voucher code"
Search 7: Check manufacturer website
```

### Step 4: Deal Verification

For each promising deal:
- ✅ Verify current availability (in stock?)
- 📅 Note expiration dates (valid until when?)
- 📝 Check conditions (minimum purchase, exclusions?)
- 💰 Validate pricing (VAT included? Shipping costs?)
- 🔗 Confirm link works (direct to product page)

### Step 5: Organize and Present

Sort findings by value and present clearly
