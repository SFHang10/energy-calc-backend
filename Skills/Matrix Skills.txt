Absolutely — this is a great exercise and very sensible for an online green / low-energy e-commerce business with external suppliers. Below is a practical, scalable roles & skills matrix plus a “spider-style” organisational structure designed for ~20 people, showing leadership, core functions, and supporting roles.

I’ll break this into 5 parts so it’s easy to use:

High-level company structure (spider view)

Roles & job families (what you have + what’s often forgotten)

Detailed role matrix with responsibilities

Example team sizing for a 20-person company

How to turn this into a skills matrix (next step)
