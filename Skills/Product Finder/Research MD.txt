# Data Sources Reference

This document provides detailed information about the search strategies and data sources used by the Sustainable Product Finder skill.

## Primary Search Strategy: Comprehensive Web Search

The skill's primary approach is to search broadly across the web to find European and UK suppliers, products, pricing, and reviews. This ensures the most current and comprehensive results.

### General Web Search Approach

**Product Discovery Searches:**
```
"sustainable [product category] Europe"
"energy efficient [product type] UK suppliers"
"low energy [product] manufacturers Europe"
"[product category] distributors UK"
"eco-friendly [product] commercial grade"
"green technology [product type] Europe"
```

**Supplier and Contact Searches:**
```
"[product] supplier UK contact information"
"[manufacturer name] distributor Europe"
"where to buy [product] UK business"
"[product category] wholesaler Europe"
"[product] installer UK phone number"
```

**Pricing and Availability Searches:**
```
"[product name] price UK"
"[product] cost Europe"
"[manufacturer] [model] buy online"
"[product] delivery UK"
"[product category] bulk pricing Europe"
```

**Reviews and Performance Searches:**
```
"[product] energy savings review"
"[product] customer reviews UK"
"[product] performance test results"
"[product] vs [competitor] comparison"
"[product] real world energy consumption"
```

### Effective Web Search Techniques

**Multi-Stage Search Process:**
1. Start with broad category searches to identify options
2. Narrow to specific products and manufacturers
3. Find supplier contact information and pricing
4. Verify with reviews and performance data
5. Cross-reference with specialized databases (ETL, Accio)

**Geographic Targeting:**
- Include "UK" or "Europe" in searches for regional results
- Search specific countries when needed: "Germany", "France", "Netherlands", etc.
- Look for ".uk" or ".eu" domains in results
- Search for "delivery to UK" or "ships to Europe" for availability

**Finding Current Information:**
- Include current year "2024" or "2025" for recent products
- Search for "new" or "latest" for current models
- Look for recent reviews and comparisons
- Check manufacturer websites for current specifications

**Extracting Contact Information:**
- Fetch supplier websites directly with web_fetch
- Look for "Contact Us", "About", or "Sales" pages
- Extract phone numbers, emails, and contact forms
- Note business hours and response times
