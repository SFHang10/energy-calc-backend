## 🔨 If You Still Want to Build Custom:

I can help you build a basic version using:
- **Claude API** (what we're using now)
- **Simple chat widget** (HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Your documents** as knowledge base
- **Embedded in your Wix site**

This would give you:
- ✅ Fully custom
- ✅ No monthly fees (just API usage)
- ✅ Complete control
- ⚠️ Takes more time upfront
- ⚠️ You maintain it

**Would take us:** 2-3 sessions to build basic version

## 🎯 My Honest Advice:

**Start with a ready-made tool** (Chatbase or Tidio). Here's why:

1. **Speed:** Live in 30 minutes vs weeks
2. **Reliability:** They handle uptime, security, updates
3. **Features:** Gets better over time without your effort
4. **Test the concept:** See if customers actually use it
5. **Upgrade later:** If it's successful, then build custom

You can always build a custom solution later if the off-the-shelf tools don't fit your needs after trying them.
