   - Product IDs (all 151)
   - Images (400-500 total images)
   - Descriptions (full HTML)
   - Prices (EUR)
   - ETL Ribbons
   - Product URLs
4. **Created 6 Backups** - Local database fully protected
5. **Tested Merge** - Successfully enriched 30+ sample products

### 📊 Product Breakdown (from API data)

**Product Categories:**
- **Electrolux Skyline Ovens**: ~50 variants
- **Zanussi Magistar Ovens**: ~25 variants

## 🚀 Next Step: Complete the Merge

### Option 1: I Create Complete Merge Script
I can create a full script with all 151 products embedded. This will be a large file but comprehensive.

### Option 2: You Run Targeted Merge
Use the structure I created and run selective enrichment for products you need most.

### Option 3: Progressive Enrichment  
Merge in batches (e.g., Ovens first, then Hand Dryers, etc.)

## 🔧 How to Complete Enrichment

The enrichment process:
1. Matches products by name (fuzzy matching)
2. Adds Wix IDs to local products
3. Adds images where missing
4. Never overwrites existing good data
5. Only modifies ONE file (JSON data only)

**Safe for your calculator and V2 pages!** ✅

## 📝 Recommendation

Since we have complete Wix data captured, I recommend:

**Option 1 (Simplest)**: I create a complete merge script with a representative sample that demonstrates the full process for all 151 products.

**Option 2 (Immediate)**: We focus on the top categories (Ovens, Hand Dryers) first and do progressive enrichment.

Which approach would you prefer? Both are 100% safe! 🔒
