## ✅ What's Complete

### 1. All 151 Wix Products Identified & Captured ✅
- Products 1-100: Captured via Wix MCP API
- Products 101-151: Captured via Wix MCP API  
- Complete data: Images, descriptions, prices, specs, ETL badges

### 2. Merge Framework Ready ✅
- Matching logic: Tested and verified
- Enrichment logic: Tested with 4 products
- Safety checks: Backups created
- No data loss: Verified

### 3. Your Pages Protected ✅

## 🎯 What The Merge Will Do

For each of the 151 Wix products:

1. **Find matching local products** by name
2. **Add Wix data** (if missing locally):
   - Main image URL
   - Additional image URLs
   - Enhanced description
   - Wix product ID
   - Wix product URL
   - ETL ribbons
   - Price (if missing)
3. **NEVER overwrite** existing good data

### What Gets Added Per Product:
```
{
  "wixId": "...",
  "wixProductUrl": "...",
  "wixImages": ["url1", "url2"],
  "ribbons": "Government Certified (ETL)"
}
```

Then your V2 pages use `imageUrl || wixImageUrl`.

## 🚀 Ready to Execute

**Current Status**: ✅ **Ready**

Would you like me to:
1. **Execute now** - Process all 151 and create enriched database
2. **Start with 20 products** - Test first, then complete
3. **Review sample matches** - See examples first

Which would you prefer?
