# Finding Your Instance ID

## ✅ You Have:
- **App ID:** `0933a02d-5312-42a8-9e67-28dfcf2aedde`
- **App Secret:** `028561ce-feaf-4a9a-9e80-e1844b446a84`

## 🔍 Finding Instance ID

The **Instance ID** is created when your app is **installed on a Wix site**.

### Option 1: Check if App is Already Installed

1. In your app dashboard, click **"Manage"** in the left sidebar
2. Look for **"Installations"** or **"Installed Sites"**
3. If you see "Greenways Buildings" listed, click on it
4. The Instance ID should be displayed there

### Option 2: Install the App on Your Site

If the app isn't installed yet:

1. In your app dashboard, look for:
   - **"Distribute"** section
   - Or **"Publish to App Market"** button
   - Or **"Install on Site"** option

2. **Install the app on "Greenways Buildings" site:**
   - Site ID: `d9c9c6b1-f79a-49a3-8183-4c5a8e24a413`
   - This will generate an Instance ID

### Option 3: Alternative - Use Site-Level Authentication

For accessing site media (videos), you might be able to use:
- **Site-level API access** instead of app instance
- This would require different authentication

## 📝 What Instance ID Looks Like:

Similar format to App ID:
- `xyz789-abc123-def456-ghi789-jkl012`

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Check "Manage" → "Installations"** first
2. If no installations, **install the app on your site**
3. Once you have Instance ID, we'll add everything to `.env`

Let me know what you see in the "Manage" section!
